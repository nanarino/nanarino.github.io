# About Me

Hello, I'm [kogawananari](https://github.com/nanarino).

Rhythm game enthusiast & Painter without talent.

My current state can be described as a **'gap decade'**. This term carries multiple meanings. Firstly, it resonates with the concept of a *'gap year'*, indicating my aversion to work and a prolonged period of enjoying a NEET lifestyle. Secondly, it nostalgically commemorates a romance from a decade ago that slipped through my fingers (the sweet puppy love of elementary school children). Lastly, I'm obsessed with the rose-colored Kamen Rider Decade.
